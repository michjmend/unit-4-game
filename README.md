jQuery game
<!-- describe the project.  -->

1. This project is a game that we have to make using jQuery. The goal of the game is to add up random numbers to equal the random target number that the computer generates.
2. This project is great practice for those using bootstrap grid and or jQuery.
3. You can get started by first creating your html and folders needed for the entire project. Here are some steps that might make things a little more organized.
   1. Pseudocode the entire process first. This might actually save you some times later down the line
   2. Don't forget link the css and javascript files to your html page! (bootstrap also)
   3. Once you finish your html, javascript next! Console logging is a big help to catch mistakes.
   4. Last, make it pretty with css!

tips that I need to remember:
-EACH crystal needs a math random function so that it'll change its value after every win or loss.
